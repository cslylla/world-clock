# World Clock App

## Project Description

*I created this project for the **SheCodes** Plus Add-on workshop. This project is a **world clock** which can be accessed through any web browser to see current time and date in different locations around the world.*

---

### 1. Key features

- The **single-site** web app is built with **JavaScript**, HTML and CSS
- I used the **moment.js** library for formatting the dates and times
- I used the **moment.js timezone** library for the different timezones
- Dark and light modes are available in the app
- You can view **all timezones**
- You also get a **random image** when you select a new timezone from the dropdown

### 2. Usage

- You can **access** the web page in any browser with an internet connection
- The app displays the time and date for three locations. The top one is for your **current location**.
- You can use the **dropdown** to select any timezone. You will see the time and date in the selected timezone immediately along with a new picture.
- You can use the **reset** button to go back to the initial view.
- You can use the **Sun** or **Moon** icon in the top right corner to switch between **light** and **dark** modes.
